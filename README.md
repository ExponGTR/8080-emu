<h1>An emulator for the Intel 8080.</h1>
<p>
  Although I'm quite happy with my Game Boy emulator, I actually planned to make it in C. Had issues with the SDL2 library which was why I switched to JavaScript.<br>
  This time, I plan to make a full emulator in C, and the Intel 8080 is kinda similar in structure so this seemed like a good idea.<br>
